# CS303_FALL22_PROJECT_Elevator_Verilog

Final term project of CS303 - Logic and System design. 

Made by me (Alperen) and my dear roommate (AnÄ±l). 
If you focus closely, you can see bloods, sweats and tears that we shed during the project.
Thank you our professor for this intense feeling of struggle; learning a new language from scratch by ourselves during the final term and writing a 1000 line code!!!
Lets stop for a moment and pay respect to those fallen soldiers who could not overcome this monstrosity of a struggle o7.
